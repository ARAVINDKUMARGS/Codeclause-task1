Basic Speech Recognition System

This project converts speech (from a .wav audio file) into text using Python's SpeechRecognition library.


---

How it works

1. The program loads a pre-recorded audio file named command.wav.


2. It uses Google's Speech Recognition API to convert the speech to text.


3. The recognized text is displayed on the console and saved to a file called task1_output.txt.

Requirements

Python 3 (works on Pydroid3 for mobile or on PC)

Install the required library:

pip install SpeechRecognition



---

Steps to Run

1. Place your audio file (e.g., command.wav) in the same folder as the script.


2. Run the script:

python task1_speech.py


3. You will see the recognized text in the console and it will also be saved in task1_output.txt.
